    <h2>What Is Coding?</h2>
    <p>Coding refers to creating computer programming code. In a more general sense, the word coding is used to refer to assigning a code or classification to something.
        Coding is the primary method for allowing intercommunication between humans and machines.
        Early coding was done through physical punch cards and similar methods.

        <h2>History Of Coding</h2>
        <p>
            As digital computers were created, early programming languages like BASIC, FORTRAN and COBOL were used, each with its own syntax and operators.
            In the personal computer and Internet age, developers and computer programmers typically produce code in modules that correspond to individual computing tasks. These modules are put together in a collective framework or project, such as an individual software application.</dt>
